{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in both images appear to be the same type of audio cassette with matching shapes and orientations. The unique labeling design is identical in both images, showing the characteristic shape and color scheme of the label. The coloration difference I mentioned earlier might be due to lighting or angle differences, but the overall identifying features strongly suggest these are the same object. The position on the shelf also supports this. Therefore, I conclude they are the same object with high confidence."}
