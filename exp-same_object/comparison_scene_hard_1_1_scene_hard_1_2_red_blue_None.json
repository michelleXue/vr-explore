{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, the chairs in the specified regions look very similar in terms of overall structureâ€”the backrest, the number of slats, and cushion color all match. The lighting and perspective differ, which could account for any minor apparent differences. There are no unique identifying features that distinguish one chair from the other, which leads to the conclusion that they are likely the same object, with high confidence. However, the certainty isn't absolute due to the potential for subtle undetectable variations."}
