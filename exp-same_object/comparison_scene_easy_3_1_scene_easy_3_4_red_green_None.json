{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects in both images appear to be the same. They share the same location relative to neighboring objects, and the design, size, and shape are consistent. The lighting and slight angle variations might cause minor perceived differences, but these do not affect the overall identification. There are no unique features that disprove they are the same object, hence maintaining a high confidence in the decision."}
