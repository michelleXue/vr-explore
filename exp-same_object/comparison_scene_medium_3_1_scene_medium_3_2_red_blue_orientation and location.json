{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"The object in the red box in Image 1 and the object in the blue box in Image 2 appear to be the same chair based on their design and details. Both are dark wooden chairs with a similar shape and style. The orientation matches, and considering the potential lighting and angle differences, they seem to be the same object. The room context further supports this, as the other similar objects and consistent decor suggest it's highly likely they are the same chair."}
