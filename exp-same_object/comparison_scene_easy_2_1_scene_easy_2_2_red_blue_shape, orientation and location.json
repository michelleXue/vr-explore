{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further analysis, the object in the red box of Image 1 and the blue box of Image 2 both appear to be chairs next to a table. They share the same style and positioning relative to the table, and there are no visible unique features or differences that suggest they are not the same object. While subtle lighting and angle differences exist, they do not affect the overall identification. The confidence score is slightly lowered to account for any unnoticeable factors."}
