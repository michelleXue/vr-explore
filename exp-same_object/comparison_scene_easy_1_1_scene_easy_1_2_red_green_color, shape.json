{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both images depict a toilet with similar design and coloration in the specified regions. The shape, particularly the tank and bowl, remain consistent in both images. While lighting and angle can slightly alter appearance, no noticeable differences suggest these are different objects. The details are aligned in terms of structure and general appearance, supporting the conclusion they are the same object. The absence of distinct variations or unique features that visibly set them apart reinforces this judgment."}
