{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"The cribs in both images have a similar design, with distinctive vertical bars and a headboard with circular decorations on top. The bedding color appears consistent as well, adding to the likelihood they are the same object. While subtle lighting differences exist, they do not significantly alter the object's appearance. Unique features like the curved headboard and the room setup support the conclusion that the same crib is depicted in both images."}
