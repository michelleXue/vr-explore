{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon re-examination, the objects within the specified regions are both rectangular and dark in color. They share similar positions on the bookshelf. There is also some text or numbering visible on them, which seems to match in style and position. The context and slight differences in lighting could cause minor discrepancies, but overall, the similarities suggest they are indeed the same object. No unique characteristics strongly indicate they are different, so confidence remains high."}
