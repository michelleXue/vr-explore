{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, the chairs in both images are still consistent in terms of shape, design, and appearance. The slight differences in viewing angle and lighting between the two images might affect the perception slightly, but there are no unique features or markings that differentiate them. The chairs have the same structural elements including armrests, backrest design, and leg style. This reinforces the conclusion that they are the same object."}
