{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects in both images appear to have the same design and features. Both objects have identical shapes, with similar headboard and footboard designs, which are distinct identifiers. The bed frame details and bedding coloration match. There are no visible differences that suggest they are different objects, so they are likely the same object. Small variations in lighting or angle do not affect the main characteristics."}
