{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon reevaluation, the objects in the specified regions are glasses on a shelf. In Image 1, the object in the red box is a single glass. In Image 2, the blue box contains a glass that is now beside another glass (green box), suggesting a change in configuration. This difference indicates that they might not be the same object. The objects' identical appearance adds uncertainty, but the altered arrangement affects the judgment of them being the same object."}
