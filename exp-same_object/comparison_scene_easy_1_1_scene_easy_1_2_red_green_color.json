{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon review, the objects in both images are still determined to be the same toilet. The design details, including the shape, structure, and coloration, match in both images. The position of the toilet relative to the wall and floor is consistent, and the setting is identical. No unique differentiating features are observed that would indicate they are different objects. Thus, there is a high confidence in the determination."}
