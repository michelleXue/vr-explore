{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, both chairs appear to have the same design, including backrest slats, armrests, and color. The positioning differences align with a change in viewing angle. There are no unique distinguishing features such as damage or distinct marks that suggest they are different. However, without seeing more of the surrounding area, there remains a slight possibility of multiple identical chairs being present, thus a slight reduction in confidence."}
