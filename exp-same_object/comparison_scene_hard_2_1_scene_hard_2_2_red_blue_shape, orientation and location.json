{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer review, the object within the red box in Image 1 appears to be slightly tilted while the object within the blue box in Image 2 is upright. The surrounding context and the objects' positions on the shelf differ slightly, with the objects in Image 2 being more evenly spaced and less tilted. These subtle differences suggest they are not the same object."}
