{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, both objects have a similar shape and color, resembling a VHS tape with the same label design. The object's placement is also very similar, but now slightly shifted in the second image. The consistency in these aspects supports the conclusion that they are likely the same object. No unique identifiers that strongly disprove this are visible."}
