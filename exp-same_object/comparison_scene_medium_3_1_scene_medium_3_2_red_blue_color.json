{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the object in the red box from Image 1 and the object in the blue box from Image 2, while both appear to be chairs, have subtle differences that could affect their identification as the same object. The design details, such as the backrest shape and color tone, might differ slightly between the two images. Without more definitive features or a clearer view of unique identifying characteristics, the initial assumption should be revised, and there is moderate confidence that they are not the same object."}
