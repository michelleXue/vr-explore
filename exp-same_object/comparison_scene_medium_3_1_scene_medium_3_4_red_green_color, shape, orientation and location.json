{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the beds in the specified regions differ slightly in terms of subtle details such as the bed positioning and proximity to the wall. While the beds' designs appear similar, their placement and orientation suggest they might be different objects. The one in the red box might be aligned differently compared to the one in the green box. Therefore, while initially appearing identical, these differences suggest they might not be the same object."}
