{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, while the chairs share similar features in color and general shape, there are subtle differences that suggest they are not the same object. The angle and perspective might slightly alter the appearance, but the positioning differs slightly regarding their alignment with the table legs. Additionally, if the second image shows a slightly different angle or size, it might indicate different objects of similar design. Without clearer unique features, it's more cautious to consider them similar but not the same."}
