{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, the objects in the specified regions still appear to be the same. They share the same color and shape, and they are positioned similarly on the countertop. There are no distinctive, differing features evident in the images that indicate they are different objects. However, there may be subtle shading or detail differences that are not clearly visible, so a slightly lower confidence score is assigned."}
