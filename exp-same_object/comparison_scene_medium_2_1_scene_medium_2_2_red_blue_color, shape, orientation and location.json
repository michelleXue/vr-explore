{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, the object in the red box in Image 1 and the object in the blue box in Image 2 are similarly positioned near the sink, suggesting they may be the same. The subtle consistent presence of a central red dot within a geometric shape indicates they are indeed the same object, likely some form of kitchen item with a distinctive design. Despite being viewed from slightly different angles, the unique hexagonal shape with the red dot remains consistent across both images, confirming they are the same object."}
