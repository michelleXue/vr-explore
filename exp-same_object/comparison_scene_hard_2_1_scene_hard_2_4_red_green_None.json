{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, the objects in both images are indeed in the same position on the shelf and share similar size, shape, and color. However, the lighting and angle might slightly differ, leading to minor visual variations. These do not constitute unique features that differentiate them as different objects, supporting the conclusion that they are the same object, though with a slightly reduced confidence score due to minor uncertainties."}
