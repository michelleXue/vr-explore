{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"After careful review, the object in the red box (Image 1) and the green box (Image 2) are indeed the same. Both objects have the same blue color, rectangular shape with slots, and the round outline that matches. Their orientation and position on the shelf are identical, reinforcing my original conclusion. No subtle differences were missed that would suggest otherwise."}
