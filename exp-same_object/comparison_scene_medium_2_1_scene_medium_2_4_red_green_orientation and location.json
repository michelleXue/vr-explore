{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the objects appear similar, subtle differences in lighting, shadow, or slight shifts in their surroundings might indicate they are not the exact same object. The context and placement are nearly identical, but without unique identifiable features or marks, there remains a small possibility of variance. Differences in perspective or angle could subtly change appearance, leading to some uncertainty. Thus, with a 0.9 confidence score, they are likely but not definitively the same object, with a slight chance of being different."}
