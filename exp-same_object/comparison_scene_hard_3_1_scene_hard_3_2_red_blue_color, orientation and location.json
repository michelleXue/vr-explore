{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon re-evaluating the images, the object in the red box (Image 1) and the object in the blue box (Image 2) appear to be the same based on shape and color. The objects in both images have a similar dark color and cover a comparable proportion of the shelf. Differences in position may be due to repositioning between the two images, but the similarities in their appearance suggest they are the same object. These subtle details and similarities in distinguishing features support this conclusion."}
