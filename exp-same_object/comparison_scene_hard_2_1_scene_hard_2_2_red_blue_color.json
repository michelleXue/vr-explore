{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both images show a similar environment and positioning on the shelf for the objects. The objects in the specified regions seem to have the same geometric shape and a similar color, which suggests they are the same. However, the angle and lighting might cause minor perception differences. There are no distinct unique features that decisively differentiate them, hence a moderately high confidence in being the same object."}
