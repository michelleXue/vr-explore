{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the toilets in both images appear very similar, subtle differences in the angle and lighting could suggest they are separate objects. The perspective in the second image shows additional detail on the side that might not match exactly with the red-boxed toilet in the first image. Without unique identifying features, I canâ€™t be completely sure they are the same, leading to a lowered confidence score."}
