{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects appear similar in design, such as the bed frame style and color. However, their positions in the room differ significantly. The object in the red box is further to the right in the room, as viewed in Image 1, while the object in the blue box is clearly on the left in Image 2. There doesn't appear to be any movement between frames. Thus, due to their fixed positions, they remain distinct objects."}
