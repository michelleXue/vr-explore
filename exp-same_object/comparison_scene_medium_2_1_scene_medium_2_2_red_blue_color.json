{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images closely, the object in the red box of Image 1 is clearly a blue cup with a white lid, while the object in the blue box of Image 2 is a wall-mounted device, likely related to kitchen utilities given its location above the sink. The shapes and purposes are distinctly different. The unique identifying feature of the cup is its color and lid, which do not match the geometric, device-like appearance of the item in Image 2. These observations further confirm they are not the same object."}
