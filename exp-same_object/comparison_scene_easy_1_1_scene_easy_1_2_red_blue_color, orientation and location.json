{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, the object in the red box in Image 1 is distinctly a toilet with a tank and bowl shape. The object in the blue box in Image 2 is a cylindrical holder, likely for a toilet brush. The shapes and functions of the objects are considerably different, confirming they are not the same object. The unique identifying features such as their shapes (rectangular vs. cylindrical) and expected usage reinforce this conclusion."}
