{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the object within the red box in Image 1 and the green box in Image 2 appear to be the same binder or file. Both are dark in color and positioned similarly on the same shelf in the bookshelf. The surroundings are consistent, with no notable changes indicative of a different object. While slight variations in lighting or angle could be present, these do not substantially alter the appearance enough to indicate a different item. Thus, it is highly likely they are the same object."}
