{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in both images appears to be the same. Both objects have the same blue body and white lid, and they are in the same position on the counter relative to other items. The subtle angle differences in the photos may create minor variations in appearance, but these do not suggest different objects. No unique identifying features in either image definitively disprove they are the same object. The confidence score is slightly adjusted to account for minor uncertainties."}
