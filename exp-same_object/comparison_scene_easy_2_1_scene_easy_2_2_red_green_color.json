{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing again, the chairs in both images have similar shapes, colors, and structures. They both have the same arm support and backrest design. The consistency in appearance suggests they are likely the same object, though the perspective difference makes some subtle details less visible. However, no unique features were observed that definitively prove they are different, so it's likely the same chair."}
