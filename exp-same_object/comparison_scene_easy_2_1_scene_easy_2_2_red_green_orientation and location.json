{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both chairs share the same design characteristics and are positioned similarly relative to the table. The wood color and backrest design are consistent. The orientation in relation to the table is similar, although slight differences in perspective could suggest variation. Unique markings or significant differentiators are not visible, so subtle differences could be due to angles or shadows. Based on available information, these are likely the same chair."}
