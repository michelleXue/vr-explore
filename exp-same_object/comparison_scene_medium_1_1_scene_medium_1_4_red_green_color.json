{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the objects in the red and green boxes share a similar shape and general color scheme, subtle differences such as the specific pattern or marking on the label could indicate they are not the same. Without distinct, unique identifying features being clearly visible, it's possible they are different. Therefore, it's more cautious to conclude they might not be the same object."}
