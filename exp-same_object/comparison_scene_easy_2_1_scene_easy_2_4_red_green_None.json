{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, there are subtle differences in the design of the chairs in the specified regions. The backrest of the chair in Image 1's red box appears slightly different compared to the chair in Image 2's green box. These differences could indicate they are not the same object, even though their overall style is similar. Unique identifying features or slight variations in shape and structure can distinguish the two, leading to a revised conclusion and a slightly lower confidence score."}
