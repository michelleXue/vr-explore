{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon additional review, the objects in both images have the same dimensions, dark color, and appearance. They both appear to be binders or folders, placed in the same position on the second shelf of the bookshelf. The surrounding items and lighting are consistent. There are no unique markings or details that suggest they are different objects, although some slight angle changes might exist due to perspective. The overall evidence still strongly supports that they are the same object."}
