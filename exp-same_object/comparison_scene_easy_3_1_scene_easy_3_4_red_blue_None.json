{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing, the object within the red box in Image 1 and the blue box in Image 2 both appear to be the same red kitchen appliance. The initial focus was incorrect, as both images show a similar object placed on the counter, with the same red color and similar features. Given the consistent positioning and context within the images, they seem to depict the same red appliance, likely a coffee machine or similar device. The reasoning was corrected to reflect this, increasing the confidence score due to the matching characteristics."}
