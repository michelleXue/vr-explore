{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon a closer review, both objects share the same basic rectangular shape with curved edges, typical of household appliances like a toaster. The position of the object on the countertop and relative proportions to adjacent objects are consistent. While there might be minor differences due to lighting or angle, no unique identifying feature suggests they are different. Therefore, the objects are likely the same, but with slightly lower confidence due to potential overlooked differences."}
