{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the objects are similar in shape and color, there are subtle differences.

The orientation might slightly differ, and such positioning could indicate they are not exactly the same object. Minor differences in their positioning and alignment can affect the conclusion."}
