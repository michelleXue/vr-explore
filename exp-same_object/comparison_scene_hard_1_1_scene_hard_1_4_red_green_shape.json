{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, there are subtle differences that suggest the chairs are not the same object. In Image 1, the chair appears slightly different in shape and design compared to the chair in Image 2. For instance, the angle and height of the backrest are not identical, which could affect judgment. Additionally, the spacing and position in relation to other chairs suggest variance. These differences indicate that while they are similar, they may not be the exact same object."}
