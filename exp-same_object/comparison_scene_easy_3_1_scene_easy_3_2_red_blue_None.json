{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, the objects in question are indeed different appliances. In Image 1, the object in the red box is a toaster, evident by its shape and size designed for toasting bread. In Image 2, the object in the blue box is a microwave, characterized by its larger size and the presence of control buttons on the side. These inherent design differences and functions confirm that they are not the same object."}
