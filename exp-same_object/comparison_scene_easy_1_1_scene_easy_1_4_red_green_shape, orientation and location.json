{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon re-evaluating, the objects in question are still consistent in their shape, design, and location with what appears to be a bathroom toilet. Both images show the object in a corner with similar wall and floor patterns. The subtle variation in lighting and perspective does not show any definitive differences that would suggest they are different objects. The unique features, like size and shape relative to the surroundings, match well."}
