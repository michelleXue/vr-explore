{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"The objects in question are both wooden chairs that appear to match in style and color. On closer examination, the details such as the armrests and backrests seem consistent, suggesting they are the same model. However, subtle differences in the perspective and possible lighting variations between the two images slightly affect the clarity. Despite these, the overall design and position relative to the table strongly indicate they are the same object, though some uncertainty remains due to the image angles."}
