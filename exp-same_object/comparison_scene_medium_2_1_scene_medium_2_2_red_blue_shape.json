{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the object in the red box in Image 1 is a take-out coffee cup with a lid, characterized by its cylindrical shape and typical disposable coffee cup appearance. The object in the blue box in Image 2 is part of the wall, likely a vent or control panel, indicated by its flat, polygonal shape and location above the sink. These objects have clear shape and functional differences. The unique identifying features, such as the coffee cup's lid and the wall-mounted object's placement and shape, definitively disprove that they are the same object. Therefore, the confidence score is 1.0, indicating absolute certainty."}
