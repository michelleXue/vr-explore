{"confidence_score":0.1,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images carefully, the object in Image 1 (red box) appears to be a device or item with slots and possibly a hexagonal feature, while the object in Image 2 (blue box) looks like a plain, closed book, possibly with a simple binding. The distinct shapes and features, such as the labels or slots in the red box versus the solid, wrapped surface of the blue box, suggest these are different objects. The identifying features do not align."}
