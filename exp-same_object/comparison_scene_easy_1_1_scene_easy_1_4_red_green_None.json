{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, the objects in both images within the specified regions are toilets with similar features: shape, design, and placement. The context and environment are consistent, indicating they are the same type of object. There are no unique identifiers that suggest they are different. The similarity in color and design strengthens the conclusion, but given lack of unique identifiers, confidence is slightly reduced."}
