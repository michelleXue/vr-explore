{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, the objects in both images are indeed toilets. Both follow the same geometric design with distinct angular features, particularly the tank's shape and the flush button on top. There are no observable differences in the design and key elements between the two images. Hence, they are the same object viewed from slightly different angles."}
