{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box from the first image is a toaster, whereas the object in the blue box from the second image is a microwave. They are placed in different positions relative to their neighboring objects, and their shapes and sizes are distinct, with the microwave being larger and having a distinctly rectangular design compared to the more rounded appearance of the toaster. These differences indicate that they are not the same object."}
