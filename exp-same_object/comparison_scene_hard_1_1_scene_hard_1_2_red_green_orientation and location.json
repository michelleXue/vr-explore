{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further examination, there are no major differences in the appearance or positioning of the objects that affect my initial judgment. The chair in the red box in Image 1 and the chair in the green box in Image 2 share consistent design characteristics and location in the room. The orientation and perspective of the images slightly differ, but the dining room setting and relative positioning to the table and other chairs are consistent, indicating they are the same object. The room's decorations and layout support this conclusion. Thus, the confidence score remains high."}
