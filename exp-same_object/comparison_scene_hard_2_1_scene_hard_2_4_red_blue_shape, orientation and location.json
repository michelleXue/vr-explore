{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, there might be subtle differences in the position and height of the objects within the images. The object in the red box (Image 1) is positioned on the upper shelf, while the object in the blue box (Image 2) is on a lower shelf. These differences suggest they may not be the same object despite their shape similarity. Due to these spatial discrepancies, it is less certain they are the same, leading to a decreased confidence score."}
