{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in both images have similar colors and shapes. One potential distinguishing feature could be any subtle differences in details or shadows, but given the lighting and perspective, these are minor. Considering the overall consistency in appearance relative to other objects and the environment, it's highly likely they are the same object. My increased scrutiny doesn't reveal significant differences that would affect previous judgment."}
