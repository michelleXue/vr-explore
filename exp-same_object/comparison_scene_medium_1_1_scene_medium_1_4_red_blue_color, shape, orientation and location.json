{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the objects in both images are similar in terms of color and general shape, there is a subtle difference in the label design. In the red box (Image 1) and blue box (Image 2), the label orientation and positioning may differ slightly, which suggests they might not be the same object. The differences aren't drastic but notable, leading to the conclusion they could be different VHS tapes."}
