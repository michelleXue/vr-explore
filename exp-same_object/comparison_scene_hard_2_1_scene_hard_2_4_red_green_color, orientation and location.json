{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both objects are similar in shape and color. However, the position relative to other items and any potential subtle differences in shading or size may suggest they are not the exact same object. The environment is consistent, but without definitive unique features, it's prudent to conclude a slight possibility of them being different. However, the high similarity still presents strong evidence for them being the same, thus giving a slight increased chance of them not being identical."}
