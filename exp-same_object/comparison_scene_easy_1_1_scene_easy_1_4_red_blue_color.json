{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"The object in the red box of Image 1 is a toilet, characterized by its shape and typical placement against a wall. The object in the blue box of Image 2 is a corner of the room, including and partially showing the same toilet, identifiable by similar surroundings and positioning. However, different perspectives and parts captured indicate they refer to the same object but not entirely visible similarity between boxes. Thus, considering object types (toilet and partial toilet view), they aren't same in box content but belong to the same furniture category if context is extended beyond just appearances."}
