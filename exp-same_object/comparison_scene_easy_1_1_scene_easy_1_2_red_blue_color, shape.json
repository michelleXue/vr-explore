{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the objects, the object in the red box (Image 1) is clearly a toilet. It has the characteristic rectangular tank and bowl shape. The object in the blue box (Image 2) is a toilet brush holder, which is cylindrical and likely has a brush handle apparent on top. The difference in shape is a definitive factor distinguishing the two objects, even if their colors might seem similar. These unique identifying features confirm they are not the same object."}
