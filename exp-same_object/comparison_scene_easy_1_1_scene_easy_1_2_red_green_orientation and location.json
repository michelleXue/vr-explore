{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, the objects in both images are indeed toilets, and they are likely the same based on their design and position against the wall. Both have a similar shape, color, and setup with a toilet paper holder in the same location. The perspective and minor differences in lighting might create subtle discrepancies, but no unique identifying features suggest they are different objects. Therefore, it is highly confident that they are the same object viewed from different angles."}
