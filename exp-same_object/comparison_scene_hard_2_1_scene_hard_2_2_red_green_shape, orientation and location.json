{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the green box in Image 2 appears to have subtle differences in color or shading compared to the object in the red box in Image 1.

The lighting and shadows could also be influencing this perception, but without more distinctive features, the confidence in identifying them as the same object decreases."}
