{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further examination, both images depict chairs in a similar setting with consistent styling, suggesting they are the same type of object. Although the angle is different, the shape and structure align closely. The lighting makes it challenging to see finer details, but there are no obvious differences to suggest they are not the same object. Therefore, I maintain that they are the same object, with a confidence score slightly adjusted to account for any missed subtle details."}
