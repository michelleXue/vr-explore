{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer review, the objects in both images still appear to be the same type, likely VHS tapes, based on their size, shape, and design. Both have similar labels with arrows, although there are slight variations in the markings possibly due to perspective or lighting. No unique features distinctly identify them as different. While subtle differences were noted, they are not significant enough to outweigh the overall similarity. Therefore, it's likely they are the same object, though with slightly less confidence."}
