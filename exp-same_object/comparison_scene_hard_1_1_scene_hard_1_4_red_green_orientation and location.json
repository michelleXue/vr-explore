{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both images show chairs that are identical in design and position relative to the table. The slight difference in perspective may have initially led to confusion. The alignment with the table and the overall setting strongly indicate that they are the same chair viewed from different angles. There are no unique features in the surroundings or the chair itself that suggest they are different. Hence, with a higher level of confidence, I conclude that they are the same object."}
