{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in the red box in Image 1 and the green box in Image 2 are very similar. Both objects have similar shapes and appear to be positioned in the same location relative to the surrounding appliances. There are no distinctive features or markings to indicate they are different. However, the lighting and angle slightly differ between the images, which could affect the perception of the object's details. Despite these subtle differences, there is still a strong likelihood they are the same object."}
