{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects in both images appear to be cribs with very similar designs. They both feature a curved dark headboard and similar bed linen colors (pink and teal), indicating they are likely the same object. Despite the angle and lighting differences, there are no significant discrepancies in the unique identifying features such as shape and color that would suggest they are different objects. Therefore, it remains highly probable that they are the same object."}
