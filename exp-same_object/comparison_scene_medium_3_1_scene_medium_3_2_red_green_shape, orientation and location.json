{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the object within the red box in Image 1 and the green box in Image 2 both depict a similar crib with identical design and positioning within the room. There are no evident differences in shape or unique identifying features that differentiate them. The object's orientation and overall appearance are consistent, suggesting they are the same object. However, the possibility of unnoticed subtle differences reduces the confidence slightly."}
