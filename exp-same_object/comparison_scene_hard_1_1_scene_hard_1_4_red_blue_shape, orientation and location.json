{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, the objects in both highlighted regions are chairs positioned around a table. The shape, size, and style seem consistent, indicating these are the same type of chair from the same set. Both images maintain the same setting with no visible differences that would suggest they are different types of chairs. However, the lighting and angle could obscure subtle differences in details, leading to a slight reduction in confidence. The overall context strongly suggests they are the same object type and likely part of the same furniture set."}
