{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in both images are located in the same position on a countertop relative to the other kitchen items. Both objects have similar dimensions and features, including buttons on the right side, suggesting they are microwaves. The apparent difference is due to the focus on different objects in the original analysis. The consistent orientation and placement make it clear that it's the same microwave in both images. The markings consistent with microwaves are definitive."}
