{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"The initial analysis overlooked that both images depict the same setting, and the objects are aligned in the same arrangement. Both specified regions in Image 1 and Image 2 show a dark red appliance, likely a coffee machine, in the same position on the counter. Changes in lighting in Image 2 might have altered the perception of color slightly. The alignment and context strongly suggest they are the same object."}
