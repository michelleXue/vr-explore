{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, both objects in the specified regions appear to be identical in shape, size, and coloring (dark blue with a white lid). While there's little variation in the shading or environment, these do not significantly differentiate the objects. The consistent features and context suggest they are the same object. The only consideration that reduces absolute certainty could be minor visual differences due to lighting or angles, but they are not evident here."}
