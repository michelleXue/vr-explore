{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the object in the red box of Image 1 and the green box of Image 2 both resemble a blocky toilet. The shape and position in a similar setting suggest they represent the same type of object. There are no distinguishing features in Image 1's view that contradict Image 2's, but the angles are different, potentially causing slight visual inconsistencies. The overall shape and context remain highly suggestive that they are the same."}
