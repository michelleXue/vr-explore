{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon revisiting the images, the object in the red box in Image 1 is a cup, identifiable by its color scheme of blue with a white top. In contrast, the object in the blue box in Image 2 is a different item entirely, likely a wall-mounted feature or control panel, distinguished by its octagonal shape and red dot. These are distinct items by shape, purpose, and placement within the environment. Thus, they are not the same object."}
