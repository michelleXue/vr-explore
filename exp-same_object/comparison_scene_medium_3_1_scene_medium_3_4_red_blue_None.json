{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the cribs in both images are similar in design and color, they are in different positions relative to other objects in the room. In the second image, the crib is positioned to the left side of the room, whereas the red-boxed crib in the first image is closer to the center of the view. Despite similar appearances, the differences in placement suggest they could be different objects."}
