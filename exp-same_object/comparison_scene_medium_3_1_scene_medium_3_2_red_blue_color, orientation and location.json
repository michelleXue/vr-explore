{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon a closer review, both objects in the images are chairs with similar designs and colors, specifically dark frames and possibly fabric covered seats. The chairs are similarly positioned next to windows with curtains, indicating they might be the same object. The background is consistent, suggesting they belong to the same room or setting. The consistency of color, design, and surroundings supports my conclusion, although subtle differences in lighting and angle could slightly affect this judgment."}
