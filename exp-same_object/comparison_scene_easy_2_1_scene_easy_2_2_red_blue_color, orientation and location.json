{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, both chairs appear similar in design and color.

The consistent context—placement near the table, similar environment—strongly suggests they are the same object, but considering potential subtle differences, the confidence score is adjusted to 0.8. No unique identifying features are apparent to definitively prove or disprove same-object status beyond the observed similarities."}
