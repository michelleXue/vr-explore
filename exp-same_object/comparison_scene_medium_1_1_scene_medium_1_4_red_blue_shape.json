{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both objects are rectangular and have a similar overall shape resembling video cassettes, there are differences in the details. The labels on the objects appear different; Image 1 has a yellow label with specific markings, while Image 2 seems to have a plain label without clear markings. These subtle label differences suggest they may not be the same object, despite the similar general shape."}
