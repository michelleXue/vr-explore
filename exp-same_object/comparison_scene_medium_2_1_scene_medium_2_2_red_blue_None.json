{"confidence_score":0.2,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box in Image 1 is a blue cup with a gray lid, while the object in the blue box in Image 2 is a hexagonal disc with a red circle, likely a wall-mounted detail or decor. The shapes and functionalities are entirely different, with no shared features indicating they are the same object. This reassessment results in a low confidence score for them being the same object."}
