{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images carefully, the object in the red box of Image 1 and the green box of Image 2 appear to be the same crib. Both have the same design with arched backrests, dark wood color, and similar bedding visible through the slats. The alignment and positioning in the room also match, indicating they are the same object. Minor variations in lighting or angle do not impact the conclusion significantly."}
