{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection of the subtleties in the two images, the objects, while similar in shape and color, show slight differences. The object in the red box from Image 1 appears to be slightly tilted, whereas the object in the green box from Image 2 is more upright, indicating a difference in orientation or potentially a different object altogether. Without unique identifying features that definitively match, it is reasonable to conclude they may not be the same object."}
