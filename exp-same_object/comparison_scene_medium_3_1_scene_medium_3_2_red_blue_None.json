{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box of Image 1 is a wooden crib or bed with a distinct frame and bedding. Meanwhile, the object in the blue box of Image 2 is a wooden chair without bedding. The differing functionalities and structures suggest they are not the same object. I remain confident in the initial assessment, with a slight adjustment in confidence score for thoroughness."}
