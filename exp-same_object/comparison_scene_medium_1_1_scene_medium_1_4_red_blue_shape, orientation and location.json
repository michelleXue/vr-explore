{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon further analysis, there are differences in the orientation and details of the objects. In Image 1, the object in the red box has a design that seems different from the object in the blue box in Image 2. Despite the same shape and size, these subtle design differences may indicate they are not the same object. Also, the location change could suggest they simply appear similar without being identical. These points lead to lower confidence that they are the same object."}
