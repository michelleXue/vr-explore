{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in Image 1's red box is a binder or folder, characterized by vertical orientation and possibly a darker color. In Image 2's blue box, the object appears to be a book that is horizontally oriented. The main differences, such as the orientation and possibly the design, confirm they are distinct objects. The objects' color similarity isn't sufficient to override the differences in shape and positioning."}
