{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box in Image 1 is the same toaster-like object that is in the green box in Image 2. Meanwhile, the object in the blue box in Image 2 is a microwave, which was visible but unboxed in Image 1. The differences in shape, size, and detail between a toaster and a microwave confirm they are not the same object. The toaster's compact, curved design is distinct from the larger, boxy microwave. Therefore, they are definitively different objects."}
