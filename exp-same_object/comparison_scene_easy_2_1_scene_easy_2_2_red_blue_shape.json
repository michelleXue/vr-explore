{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, the chairs in both the red box of Image 1 and the blue box in Image 2 appear to have the same design, with similar backrest patterns, armrests, and leg structures. Although the angle of the images might cause slight perception differences, there are no discernible features that indicate they are different objects. Subtle details such as the overall proportions and construction suggest they are the same. Therefore, my judgment remains that these are the same objects, with a high degree of confidence."}
