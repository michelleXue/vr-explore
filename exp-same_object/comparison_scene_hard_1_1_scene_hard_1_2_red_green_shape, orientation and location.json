{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects in the red and green boxes are likely the same chair. They have identical shapes, and they are both situated at the end of a similar-looking table. While subtle differences in lighting might exist, the overall design appears consistent. Unique features like the shape of the backrest and seat size match between the two images, which supports the conclusion that they are the same object. The confidence score is slightly lowered to account for potential lighting differences that could affect visual perception."}
