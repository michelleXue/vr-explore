{"confidence_score":0.99,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, both images contain a similar styled toilet. The object within the red box in the first image is seen from the front, clearly showing a toilet with a cistern and bowl shape. The object in the blue box in the second image is from a slightly side angle, but it still shows the same toilet design and structure. The position and relative features like the tank lid and base shape align. No unique features in one image disprove it's the same toilet from a different angle. Thus, itâ€™s highly likely they are the same object."}
