{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing, the objects share a similar shape and color, both cylindrical and white. The positions and settings are consistent, without any discernible unique features in the images to differentiate them. Given the lack of distinguishing details, it's reasonable to conclude they are likely the same object. However, the confidence is slightly adjusted for the possibility of minor, unseen variations."}
