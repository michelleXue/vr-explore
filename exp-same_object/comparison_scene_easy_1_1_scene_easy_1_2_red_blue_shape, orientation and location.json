{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box in Image 1 is clearly a toilet, with a tank and bowl structure. The object in the blue box in Image 2 is a toilet brush holder, cylindrical and without the distinct toilet features. The shape, function, and positioning on the floor vs. against the wall confirm they are different objects. No subtle details suggest they are the same."}
