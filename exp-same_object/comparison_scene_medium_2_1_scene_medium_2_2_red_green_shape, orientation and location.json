{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, both objects are blue cups with white lids and appear identical in shape and color. They are similarly positioned relative to the sink. There are no visible distinguishing features to suggest they are different objects. The lighting and perspective are consistent, reinforcing the conclusion that they are the same object. The high similarity in appearance and context supports a high confidence in this assessment, although subtle environmental variations might slightly affect judgment, hence a slight adjustment from full certainty."}
