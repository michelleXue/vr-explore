{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further analysis, the chairs in both images have the same general shape, with squared backrests and similar leg structures. The positioning near the table and room setting are consistent. Any difference in appearance can be attributed to the angle and lighting, but no unique or differing identifiers suggest they are different objects. The pattern and context remain largely unchanged, supporting the assessment that these are the same chairs."}
