{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, the object in the red box of Image 1 and the green box of Image 2 appear identical. Both have the same shape, size, and placement on the countertop between the espresso machine and the microwave. There are no visible unique identifying features that suggest they are different. The consistent context and alignment strengthen the assessment that they are the same object, though slight differences in lighting might affect the perception. Therefore, my confidence is slightly adjusted to 0.9."}
