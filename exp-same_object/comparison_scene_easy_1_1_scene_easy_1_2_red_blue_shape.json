{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the two objects have noticeable differences. The object in Image 1 is boxy with multiple flat surfaces, suggesting it's likely a toilet tank, not a cylindrical shape. In contrast, the object in Image 2 is cylindrical and appears more like a toilet brush holder. These distinguishing shapes and forms lead to the conclusion that these are not the same object. The unique flat top surface of the object in Image 1 is a key identifying feature that distinguishes it from the cylindrical object in Image 2."}
