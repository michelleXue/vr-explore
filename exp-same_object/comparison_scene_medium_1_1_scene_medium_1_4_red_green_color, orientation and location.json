{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon review, the objects within the red box in Image 1 and the green box in Image 2 still appear to be the same. Both have the same design and coloration. Their placement and orientation are identical, being on the middle shelf of the bookcase. Despite any minor visual differences in lighting or angle, there are no unique identifying features to suggest they are different objects. The surrounding environment, such as the wall design and the globe, remains consistent. Therefore, conclusions about them being the same object maintain stability."}
