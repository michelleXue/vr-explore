{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon revisiting the images, both objects appear to be the same wooden chair design with armrests. The color and style match closely. The orientations differ slightly due to the angle of the photos, but both are positioned similarly relative to the tabletopâ€”on the left side when facing the table. No unique marks or distinguishing features are visible to differentiate them as separate chairs. Any discrepancies seem minor and result from perspective. However, given the additional review, I adjusted my confidence to account for any unseen details."}
