{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reevaluating, the object in the red box of Image 1 is indeed a toilet, and the object in the blue box of Image 2 is also a toilet. They share similar colors and shapes, which are consistent with typical toilet designs. The orientation and setting appear to match. While the perspective varies slightly between the two images, there are no distinct features that indicate they are different objects. Therefore, I maintain that they are the same object with slightly adjusted confidence due to potential for different models being superficially similar."}
