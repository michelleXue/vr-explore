{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further inspection, the chairs in both images have matching armrest designs, backrest styles, and overall coloring, which are distinguishing features. The perspective and shadows might create slight differences in appearance, but there are no significant deviations to suggest different objects. Both chairs are positioned at a similar angle next to a table, reinforcing the likelihood that they are the same object. The confidence score is slightly reduced to account for any possible subtle differences not previously considered."}
