{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both objects are chairs, there are subtle differences that may suggest they are not the same object.

Additionally, the orientation and surrounding arrangement seems distinct enough to consider them separate objects within similar settings. Without more distinctive features to confirm, it's safer to conclude they are not the same."}
