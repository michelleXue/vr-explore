{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box in Image 1 is part of a crib, characterized by horizontal and vertical bars with an arched top. In contrast, the object in the blue box in Image 2 is clearly a chair, with a flat backrest and distinct legs. The structural and design differences are significant and consistent across both images, confirming they are not the same object. There are no unique matching features that would suggest otherwise."}
