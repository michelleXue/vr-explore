{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both images show a binder-like object with similar slots or dividers visible. The unique identifying feature appears to be the arrangement and design of these slots, which are consistent in both images. The lighting and angle are slightly different but do not indicate a change in the object itself. Given these observations, it's highly likely (0.95) that these are the same object."}
