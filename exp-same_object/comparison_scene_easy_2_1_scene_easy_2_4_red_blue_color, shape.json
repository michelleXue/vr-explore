{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, both chairs have a similar design, color, and structure. The angle of view and lighting can cause slight variations in appearance, but the armrests, backrest, and legs are consistent in style across both images. Without clear distinguishing marks, it remains highly plausible they are identical, albeit seen from different perspectives. As such, the determination remains the same, but I acknowledge the potential for minor unnoticeable differences that could arise from the view angles."}
