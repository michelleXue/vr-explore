{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both images feature an object on a shelf that appears similarly structured. The object in both the red box of Image 1 and the blue box of Image 2 have a rectangular shape. The coloring seems to match as well, though lighting may have influenced the appearance. Given the consistent placement and shape, it is highly likely they are the same object viewed from the same angle in differing lighting conditions. Unique identifying features, such as the rectangular form and general placement, support this conclusion."}
