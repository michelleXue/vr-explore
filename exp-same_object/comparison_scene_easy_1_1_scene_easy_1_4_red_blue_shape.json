{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the object in the red box of the first image and the object in the blue box of the second image both share a similar angular, geometric shape characteristic of a toilet tank. The distinctive features, such as the top flat surface and the slight protrusions at the base, align with the design of a toilet. Despite the different angles, the structural elements suggest it is the same toilet. The unique shape matches well, increasing the confidence in identifying them as the same object."}
