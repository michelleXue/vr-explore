{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both objects share the same general design, color, and style, characterized by dark tones and a similar shape of the backrest and seat. The key feature here is the consistent design of the chairs without any noticeable unique identifying characteristics that differentiate them. Slight differences in perspective and lighting might alter their appearance minimally but donâ€™t significantly impact the conclusion that these are the same type of chair."}
