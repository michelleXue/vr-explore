{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"After careful review, it is evident that the objects in the red and blue boxes are not the same. The object in the red box (Image 1) is a toilet, which is large, with a flat top and a seat. The object in the blue box (Image 2) is a toilet brush holder, which is cylindrical and much smaller. These have distinct shapes and functions that serve as unique identifying features, definitively proving they are not the same object."}
