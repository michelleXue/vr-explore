{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, there are subtle differences in the orientation and position of the objects in the images. In the first image, the red-boxed object is placed more upright, while the green-boxed object in the second image is tilted differently. Additionally, the slight shift in their positions on the shelf suggests they may not be the same object. Without unique identifying features like color differences or distinct markings, it's challenging to definitively prove they are the same. The differences in orientation imply they might be separate objects arranged similarly."}
