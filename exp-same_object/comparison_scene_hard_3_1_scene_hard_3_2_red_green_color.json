{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the details, the object in the red box in the first image and the green box in the second image are both primarily dark in color and have a similar shape and design. They are both positioned in exactly the same shelf location, which supports the conclusion. Additionally, the presence and arrangement of nearby objects are consistent between the two images, further reinforcing that these are indeed the same object. There are no obvious differences or unique identifying features that suggest otherwise. Therefore, I confirm that they are the same object with a confidence score of 1.0."}
