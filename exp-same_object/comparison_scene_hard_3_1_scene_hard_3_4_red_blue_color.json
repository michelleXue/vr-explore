{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer review, the object in the red box in Image 1 appears to be a binder due to its slim shape and color, while the object in the blue box in Image 2 appears to be a book with a thicker profile and a different, darker color. These differences in shape, thickness, and color suggest they are not the same object. The lack of unique features linking them further supports this conclusion."}
