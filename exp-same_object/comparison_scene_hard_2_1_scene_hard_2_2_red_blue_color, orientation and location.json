{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both objects appear similar in shape and color, there is a subtle difference. In the second image, the object within the blue box is slightly tilted or has a different alignment compared to the object in the red box in the first image. This could suggest they are not the same object but rather similar ones. The arrangement of surrounding objects is also slightly different between the images, which might indicate multiple similar items are present. This introduces uncertainty, leading to a cautious assessment that they might not be the same object."}
