{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both objects appear to be the same white appliance, suggested to be a toaster. The similarity in shape and color indicates they are the same object despite the presence of other appliances nearby, which may initially be misleading. There are no unique identifying features that distinguish them as different appliances. Therefore, I am confident that they are indeed the same object."}
