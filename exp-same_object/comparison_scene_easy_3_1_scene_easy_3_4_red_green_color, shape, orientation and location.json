{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, the objects in the specified regions in both images appear to have matching shapes and colors, indicative of a typical toaster style. They are both situated on a counter between two larger appliances, maintaining a consistent placement. There are no unique identifying features that suggest they are different objects. While the perspective might vary slightly, all visible characteristics align, thus it's reasonable to conclude they are the same object. However, this is not absolute, so the confidence score is slightly decreased to account for any minor inconsistencies not visible in the images."}
