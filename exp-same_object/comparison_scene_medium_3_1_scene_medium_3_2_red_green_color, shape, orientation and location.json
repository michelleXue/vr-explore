{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, the objects in both images within the specified regions are cribs with identical design patterns and colors. The cribs have the same headboard design and foot structure. The objectâ€™s design and color are consistent across both images, and there are no distinguishing features that suggest they are different. The rooms have similar layouts, which further supports the notion that they are the same object. Any subtle differences are likely due to lighting or angle changes, thus maintaining high confidence that they are the same object."}
