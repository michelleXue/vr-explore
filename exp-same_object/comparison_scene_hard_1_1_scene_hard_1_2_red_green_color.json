{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further inspection, the objects within the specified regions in both images are chairs with similar design and color. The lighting makes them appear slightly different but does not significantly alter the overall color, which is a key factor here. Both chairs seem to be part of the same set around a dark table in the same room, supporting the conclusion that they are the same object, though minor visual differences might affect judgment slightly."}
