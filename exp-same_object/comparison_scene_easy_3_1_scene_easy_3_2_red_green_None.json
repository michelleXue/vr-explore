{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, there are no subtle differences that suggest the object in the red box in the first image is different from the object in the green box in the second image. Both are white toasters with identical shapes and positions relative to neighboring appliances. There are no unique features that differentiate them in any way. Thus, I maintain that these are the same object with a high level of confidence."}
