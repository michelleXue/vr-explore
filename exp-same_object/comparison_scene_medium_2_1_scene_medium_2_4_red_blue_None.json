{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the cups in the specified regions are slightly different. The subtle differences in their positions and orientation on the counter suggest they might not be the same object despite their similar appearance. Without more distinctive features or markings, it is challenging to definitively confirm they are the same. Unique identifying details are lacking, leaving room for doubt, leading to a lower confidence score."}
