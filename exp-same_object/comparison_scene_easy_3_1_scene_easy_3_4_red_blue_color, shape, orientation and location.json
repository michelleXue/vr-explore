{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, Image 1's red-boxed object is the toaster as previously identified. It's possible the context and background similarities could cause confusion, but they serve distinct roles: \n\nImage 2's blue-boxed object is a red coffee machine with detailed features like dials and levers. Its orientation and specific functions make it distinctly different from the toaster.\n\nUnique features such as shape and interactive parts (dials and handles vs. slots) confirm they are not the same object. The color contrast between the gray toaster and red coffee machine supports this conclusion."}
