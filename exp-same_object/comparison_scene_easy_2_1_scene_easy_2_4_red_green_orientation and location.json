{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both objects are chairs with similar design attributes, their orientation and exact placement alongside the table may suggest different objects. Subtlities like angle and alignment related to the table edges could indicate they are not identically placed. Given this potential discrepancy, it is prudent to conclude that they might not be the same chair, despite their similar appearance in style and color. The change in perspective could also cause differences in appearance and alignment, but without distinct identifiers, a definitive conclusion is challenging."}
