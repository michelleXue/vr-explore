{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both objects in Image 1 and Image 2 appear to be similar in color and have a distinctly rectangular shape, suggesting they could be the same object. The primary difference observed is their shelf placement, which might have led to initial confusion. The rectangular shape, color, and appearance strongly indicate they are the same object despite the different shelf locations."}
