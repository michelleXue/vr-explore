{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the chairs in both images have similar designs, there is a subtle difference in position and alignment that may affect the judgment. In Image 1, the chair is directly facing the table, while in Image 2, the angle suggests it is slightly turned. This could potentially indicate these chairs are from the same set but are not the same exact object instance. The difference in alignment due to the varied perspective is enough to lower the confidence in them being the same object instance."}
