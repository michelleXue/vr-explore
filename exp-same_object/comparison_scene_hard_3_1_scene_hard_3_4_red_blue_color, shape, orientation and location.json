{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in Image 1 (red box) is a file binder or box placed on the middle shelf. It has a distinct binder-like structure with a visible label area or pattern on its front.\n\nThe object in Image 2 (blue box) is a book on the bottom shelf. It clearly appears to have a classic bound spine, which is characteristic of a book, along with a defined edge contrast between the cover and the pages.\n\nThe distinguishing features such as the object's structure and placement on different shelves lead to the conclusion that they are not the same object. The binder-like structure versus the book format is a significant identifying feature. Confidence score is 0.95 due to clear differences in structure, shelf location, and overall appearance."}
