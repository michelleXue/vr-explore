{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both images depict toilets with the same general shape and dimensions, located adjacent to a wall. The consistent placement against a corner wall and similar color suggest they are the same object. Any differences might be due to lighting or viewing angle variations. There are no unique details that disprove they are the same, so it seems reasonable to conclude they are identical based on available information."}
