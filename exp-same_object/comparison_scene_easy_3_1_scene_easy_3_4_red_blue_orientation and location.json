{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, in Image 1, the object in the red box is a toaster. In Image 2, the object in the blue box is also an espresso machine, but the intended comparison seems to involve the green box, which contains a toaster. Both images showcase a toaster with similar design and identical positioning relative to the surrounding objects, indicating they are the same. The consistent presence of a microwave to the right in the arrangement strengthens this conclusion."}
