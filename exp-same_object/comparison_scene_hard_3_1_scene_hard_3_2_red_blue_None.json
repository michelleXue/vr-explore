{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon review, the object in the red box in Image 1 is a blue binder or file with a labeling area and a large circular hole, typical of file binders. In the second image, the object in the blue box is a closed, dark-bound book with visible pages or a thick cover. These objects differ in shape, size, and function. The visible pages and cover texture of the object in the blue box are distinct from the flat, uniform appearance of the binder. Therefore, they are not the same object."}
