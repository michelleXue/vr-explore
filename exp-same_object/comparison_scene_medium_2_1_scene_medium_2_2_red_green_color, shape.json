{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, both objects are blue with white lids, and they share the same shape, which makes them appear to be disposable coffee cups. There are no noticeable differences or unique features that would suggest they are different objects. The context of both images also implies they are the same object. Given these observations, I am confident they are the same object with a high degree of certainty."}
