{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box in Image 1 appears to be a rectangular ring binder or folder on the middle shelf. In Image 2, the object in the blue box is a closed book on the bottom shelf. The key differences are the location and type: a binder-like object versus a flat, book-like object. These distinguishing factors contribute strongly to the conclusion that they are not the same object, reinforcing the previous assessment."}
