{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the chairs in both images have identical design features, such as the same number of slats on the backrest and similar leg and armrest structures. The orientation and placement under the table are consistent in both images, and the lighting conditions appear similar, leading to little visual discrepancy. There are no unique identifying features that suggest they might be different. Therefore, it is highly likely that they are the same object."}
