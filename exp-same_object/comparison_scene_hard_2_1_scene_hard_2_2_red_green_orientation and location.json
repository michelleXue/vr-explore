{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"After re-evaluating, the objects in the specified regions appear to be the same. Both are located on a middle shelf of a cupboard, with their positions slightly adjusted relative to other objects but essentially maintaining the same orientation. The shapes and placement align closely. The slight change in angle and the presence of additional objects in Image 2 could suggest a possible rearrangement, but they do not definitively indicate different objects."}
