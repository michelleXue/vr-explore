{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing, the objects in both images are very similar. They have identical color, shape, and style. The orientation appears slightly different due to the angle of view, but the proximity to the table and the design details, such as the armrests and backrest, confirm they are likely the same object. There are no distinctive features that suggest they are different, reinforcing the likelihood of them being the same chair. Thus, the confidence remains high at 0.9."}
