{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects in the red box (Image 1) and blue box (Image 2) maintain the same overall shape, color, and design features.

Thus, it's likely they are the same, but given the image quality, a small uncertainty remains."}
