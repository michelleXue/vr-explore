{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further inspection, both objects in the images are chairs positioned at a similar angle and have the same design elements, such as the chair back's shape and the leg structure. Although the lighting or perspective slightly varies, affecting the visibility of certain features, these factors do not significantly alter the overall characteristics of the objects. There are no unique features showing differences, so it's reasonable to conclude they are the same object."}
