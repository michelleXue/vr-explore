{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon further review, the object in the red box of the first image is a blue cup with a lid, while the object in the blue box of the second image is a hexagonal or octagonal wall fixture, likely a dial or valve. The significant differences in shape (cylindrical cup vs. polygonal fixture) and function confirm that these are not the same object. The unique identifying features such as the shape and context (cup vs fixture) further support this conclusion."}
