{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon revisiting the images, the object in the red box in Image 1 appears to be a rectangular box or binder with a distinct spine, similar to the object in the green box in Image 2. However, the object in the blue box in Image 2 appears flatter, perhaps a different type of object like a book. The orientation and dimensions seem to differ, and they are placed on different shelves. The consistent presence of the rectangular box in a different location suggests they are not the same object. Despite some similarities, the placement and potential type differences are key identifying features."}
