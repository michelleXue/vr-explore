{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects inside the red and blue bounding boxes both appear to be dark brown chairs with armrests. There don't appear to be any unique identifying features or differences in construction that clearly differentiate them. The light and perspective are slightly different, which might cause subtle perceived differences, but these do not significantly impact the assessment. Both chairs look identical in color and design, reinforcing the conclusion that they are the same object. However, without more detailed features or identifiers visible, there's a small margin of error, leading to a confidence score of 0.8."}
