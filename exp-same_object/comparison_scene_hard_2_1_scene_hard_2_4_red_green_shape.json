{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in both images appear to be identical in shape and size, resembling cylindrical cups or glasses. The lighting and perspective are consistent between the images, indicating that they are the same object. There are no unique identifying features or differences that suggest they are distinct objects. However, since these items lack distinct markings or colors, the confidence is slightly less than absolute."}
