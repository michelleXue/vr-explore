{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, the objects in both the red and blue boxes seem to share the same basic characteristics such as shape and color. They are cylindrical and appear to be positioned similarly in both images. However, uncertainties remain due to possible subtle differences that might not be very clear due to perspective and lighting. The surroundings and context are the same, supporting the conclusion that they are likely the same object. Thus, while some uncertainty remains, it is reasonable to conclude they are the same object."}
