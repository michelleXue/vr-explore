{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the chairs in both images are similar in style and color, there are subtle differences that could affect judgment. The positioning and orientation of each chair might not be exactly the same; for instance, the distance of each chair from the table appears slightly varied. Minor details in angles or chair positioning might disprove they are the same object. Without distinct identifying marks, it's challenging to definitively prove they are the same, leading to a lower confidence score and a conclusion that they might not be the same object."}
