{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon careful review, the object in the red box (Image 1) appears to be a crib or bed with a distinct headboard design, and the object in the blue box (Image 2) is a chair. The crib has a more substantial build with a specific shape and orientation suitable for sleeping, while the chair is designed for sitting, with a simpler and more open design. These unique features, including their distinct shapes and functions, confirm they are not the same object."}
