{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the details, both images indeed depict a chair of the same style and color near the corner of a table. However, slight variations in lighting or perspective might result in minor differences in appearance. The consistent design, dimensions, and location alongside a similar table strongly suggest they are the same object. No distinguishing unique features were noted to contradict this conclusion."}
