{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both images depict a chair with a similar design, specifically the backrest and armrest features, positioned next to a table. The color is consistently brown, and the location relative to the table suggests they are the same. The main difference lies in the lighting and camera angle, which might influence depth perception, but overall their characteristics are identical. No unique features contradict this conclusion, reinforcing that they are likely the same object."}
