{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reevaluating, the chairs in both images have similar design features: armrests, a flat backrest, and similar leg structure. There aren't noticeable differences in design or color that suggest they are different objects. Both chairs are positioned similarly relative to the table, supporting the idea they are likely the same object, though slight variations in lighting or perspective may exist. No unique identifying marks are visible to definitely distinguish them as different."}
