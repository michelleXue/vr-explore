{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in the highlighted regions of both images still appear to be the same type of objectâ€”a toilet. The shape of the tank and bottom are consistent across both images. The coloring and general form match as well. The angle and lighting are slightly different, which might cause minor perceived differences, but there are no distinct features indicating they are different models or types. Thus, I maintain they are the same object, though slightly reducing confidence to allow for any subtle overlooked differences."}
