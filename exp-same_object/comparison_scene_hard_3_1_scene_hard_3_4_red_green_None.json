{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the object in both images appears to be identical. Both objects have a rectangular shape with similar markings and positioning on the shelf. The presence of what looks like a hexagonal symbol and similar color scheme further supports that they are the same object. The environment and context remain consistent, reinforcing this conclusion. However, small variations in lighting or perspective might affect subtle details, leading to a slightly reduced confidence score."}
