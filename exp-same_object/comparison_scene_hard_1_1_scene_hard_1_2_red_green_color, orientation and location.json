{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the chair in the red box in Image 1 and the one in the green box in Image 2 share the same design, color, and are in a similar position in relation to a dark table. The room's consistent wallpaper and furnishings reinforce the likelihood of it being the same object. Any differences in lighting do not sufficiently distinguish them as different objects, so it is reasonable to conclude they are the same chair."}
