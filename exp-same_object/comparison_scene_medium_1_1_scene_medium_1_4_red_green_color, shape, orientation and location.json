{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, key features align: the objects in both images have the same shape, resembling VHS tapes with a central label and similar markings. The coloring and placement are consistent, both being on the upper shelf of the bookshelf. There are no apparent differences or unique identifying features that suggest they are not the same object, confirming they are likely the same. Although the lighting or angle might introduce slight perceived differences, these are minor and do not affect the conclusion significantly."}
