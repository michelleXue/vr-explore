{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"After reviewing the images, it's clear that the objects in the specified regions are not the same. In Image 1, the red box highlights a small, likely rounded white object, which appears to be a toaster. In Image 2, the blue box contains a larger rectangular object with a black front, likely a microwave. The differences in shape, size, and the presence of a display and buttons on the microwave conclusively indicate they are different objects."}
