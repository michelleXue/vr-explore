{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further examination, the chairs in both the red box of the first image and the blue box of the second image have consistent features like the same design of the backrest, armrests, and overall structure. The orientation of the chairs is alike, suggesting the same object with slight positional differences due to angles. Although there might be slight perspective variations, the lack of distinguishing features implies a high likelihood of them being the same object."}
