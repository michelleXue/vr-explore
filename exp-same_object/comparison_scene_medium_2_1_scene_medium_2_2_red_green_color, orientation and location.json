{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both objects are similar in color and general design (blue with a white lid), the orientation and position relative to other objects may differ slightly. Additionally, subtle differences in lighting or angle in the images could suggest they are not exactly the same object, though this is less definitive. Without unique identifying features, it's challenging to be completely certain, but it's plausible they are different instances of a similar object."}
