{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer analysis, both objects are similar in color and shape (blue disposable cup with white lid), but there are noticeable differences. The stickers or labels on the cups might not be identical, which is a unique identifier. The perspective and lighting in the images are different, but the placement of the objects relative to other items in the scene suggests they might not be the same object. Therefore, there is a reasonable doubt that these might be different objects."}
