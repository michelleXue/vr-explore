{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both chairs share identical features: the same dark color and structure. Their positioning in the room relative to the table supports them being part of the same set. The subtleties of the design, such as the backrest shape and overall style, appear consistent across both images. The environment also appears unchanged, which suggests these are indeed the same type of chair in the same context. There are no unique identifying features that differentiate them distinctly from each other."}
