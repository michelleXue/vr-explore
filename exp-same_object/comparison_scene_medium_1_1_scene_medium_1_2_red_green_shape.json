{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, the objects in the red box (Image 1) and green box (Image 2) still appear to be the same due to their matching shape and size. Both objects have a similar design with two trapezoidal ends, and this distinct shape is consistent between images. The labels on the objects also appear similar, though lighting or angle could cause slight appearance differences. No unique identifying features disprove their sameness. The confidence score is adjusted slightly lower to account for the possibility of minor details affecting the judgment."}
