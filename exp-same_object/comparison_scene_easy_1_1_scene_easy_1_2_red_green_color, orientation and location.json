{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"The object in the red box in Image 1 and the object in the green box in Image 2 both appear to be a toilet. They share the same shape, color, and placement relative to the wall and floor. While the perspectives differ, the structural features are consistent with it being the same object. No unique features differentiate them to suggest otherwise, leading to a high confidence that they are indeed the same object."}
