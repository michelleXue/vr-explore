{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, there are subtle differences between the chairs in terms of their alignment with the table. In the first image, the chair in the red box seems to be more directly aligned and closer to the table corner, while the chair in the blue box of the second image is slightly set back and looks different in angle relative to the fireplace. The positioning against the surroundings gives a clearer indication that they are not the same object. Unique orientation differences, especially their placement in the room, support this conclusion."}
