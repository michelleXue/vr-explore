{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the shape and color appear similar, the position and orientation of the objects differ slightly between the images. In the first image, the red-boxed object is located on the upper shelf, while in the second image, the blue-boxed object is on the lower shelf. This change in location suggests they are not the same physical object, even though they have similar appearances."}
