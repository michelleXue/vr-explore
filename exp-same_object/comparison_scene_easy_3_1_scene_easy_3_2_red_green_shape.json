{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, the objects in the red and green boxes appear visually identical in terms of shape, size, and structure.

Both have a rectangular base with similar proportions and curvature, pointing towards them being the same object, likely a toaster. The context and arrangement also support this judgment."}
