{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the objects appear to be similar in shape and likely are the same type of glass or cup, there may be subtle differences in positioning or angles that suggest they might not be the exact same object. The perspective in each image is different enough that it could be hiding subtle differences or rotation between the items. Without distinct markings or features, it's challenging to definitively prove they're identical."}
