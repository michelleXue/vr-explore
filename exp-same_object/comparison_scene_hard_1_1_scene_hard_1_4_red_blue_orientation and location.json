{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, both images show a similar table and chair set up, indicating they are the same object. The chairs around the table have the same design and color. The angles from which the images are taken might lead to slight differences in perspective, but other details like the wallpaper pattern and paintings in the background are identical. These consistent elements across both images strongly suggest the object in question is the same, although subtle lighting differences could affect perception slightly."}
