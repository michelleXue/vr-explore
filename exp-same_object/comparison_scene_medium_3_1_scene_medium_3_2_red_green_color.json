{"confidence_score":0.65,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, there are differences that suggest these objects may not be the same. While both images show a bed with a black frame, the color of the bedding is a critical factor. In Image 1, the bedding appears darker compared to the more visible colors in Image 2. Additionally, small details in the shape of the frame and potential differences in padding may indicate distinct objects. These subtle differences could affect judgment, and without more identifying features, confidence in them being the same is reduced."}
