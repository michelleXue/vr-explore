{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both chairs have similar designs and are positioned next to a table in a room with wood flooring, subtle differences indicate they might not be the same. The orientation and slight variations in the backrest shapes suggest a possibility of being different objects, albeit quite similar. Without more distinct identifiers like unique markings or positions relative to other unique items in the room, there remains some level of uncertainty. It is safer to consider them as possibly not the same object."}
