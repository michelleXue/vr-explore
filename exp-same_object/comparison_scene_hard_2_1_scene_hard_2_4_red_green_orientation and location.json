{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"On closer inspection, while the objects in both images are similar in shape and size, there is a subtle difference in the lighting and shading that might affect their appearance. The object's position and orientation seem consistent, but without more distinct unique features or identifying marks, it's challenging to definitively prove they are the same object. Due to these uncertainties, there is some doubt, leading to a lower confidence score and concluding they might not be the same object."}
