{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the cribs in the red box (Image 1) and the blue box (Image 2) are very similar, but they are distinct objects. The key differences lie in their position and slight variations in detail. The fact that two identical cribs are side by side supports them being separate entities. Although they are similar in color and design, their distinct placements in each image suggest they are not the same object."}
