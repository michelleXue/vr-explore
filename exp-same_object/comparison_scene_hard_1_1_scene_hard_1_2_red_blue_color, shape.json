{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, both chairs have similar high backs and appear to be placed at the end of a rectangular table. Although the lighting differs slightly between the images, and the angle of view is not identical, these factors do not significantly alter the assessment. The consistent design and setup in the room reinforce the likelihood they are the same object. The unique features, such as the design of the chair backs and seating arrangement, do not show any discrepancies that would disprove they are the same object."}
