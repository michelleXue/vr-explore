{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon thorough review, the object in Image 1 within the red box is clearly a toilet with a distinct tank and lid. The object in Image 2 within the blue box is a toilet paper stand or holder, characterized by its cylindrical shape. These differences in shape and function are definitive and indicate that they are not the same object. The objects serve different purposes and are constructed differently, with unique features that clearly distinguish them."}
