{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, in Image 1 the object in the red box appears to be straight with uniform coloration. In Image 2, the object in the blue box has a slight tilt and could have different shading or texture compared to the one in Image 1. These small differences in alignment and possible texture could indicate they are not the same object. Additionally, the presence of another nearby object makes it possible for mix-up due to proximity. These subtle differences lead to a revision of the initial assessment."}
