{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in both images have similar shapes and color patterns.

There are no unique markings or features to definitively distinguish them as different objects. Based on available evidence, it's reasonable to conclude they are the same object, although there is some uncertainty due to positional differences."}
