{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the blue box from Image 2 has a slightly different orientation compared to the object in the red box from Image 1. While the shapes are similar, there is a possibility that the object in Image 2 could have been moved or replaced. Additionally, the appearance of an adjacent object in Image 2 suggests a change in arrangement, which might indicate they are not the same object. However, the lack of distinctive markings makes this conclusion uncertain, resulting in a decrease in confidence."}
