{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further examination, the object in the red box in Image 1 and the object in the blue box in Image 2 appear to be the same. They share the same shape as takeout coffee cups with lids, and their position relative to the other items on the counter is consistent. No unique or distinguishing marks indicate they are different. The only variation might be lighting or angle, but these do not substantively change the object's identity."}
