{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects in both images have consistent overall shapes and seem to belong to the same style of chair, typical for a dining room setting. There could be subtle differences not visible due to the lighting or angle, but the images show similar design traits such as the flat backrest and straight legs. The environment, with matching wallpaper, also supports the interpretation that these chairs are from the same set. However, without distinct markings or colors visible, the original confidence score has been slightly adjusted to account for potential unseen differences."}
