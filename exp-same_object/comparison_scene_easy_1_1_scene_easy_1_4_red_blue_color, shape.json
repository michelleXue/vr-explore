{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both images depict a toilet. In Image 1, the red box clearly frames a toilet. Image 2, within the blue box, also shows the same toilet, but from a slightly different angle and lighting. The key features such as the tank and the shape of the lower part are consistent, confirming they are the same object from different views."}
