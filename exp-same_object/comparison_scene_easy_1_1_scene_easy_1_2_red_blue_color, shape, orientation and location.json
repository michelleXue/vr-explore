{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"The object in the red box in Image 1 is a toilet, characterized by its shape with a tank and bowl. In Image 2, the object in the blue box appears to be a toilet brush holder, which is smaller and cylindrical in shape. The distinct differences in shape, size, and purpose, along with their respective positions (to the left of the wall and closer to the ground for the brush holder), confirm that they are not the same object."}
