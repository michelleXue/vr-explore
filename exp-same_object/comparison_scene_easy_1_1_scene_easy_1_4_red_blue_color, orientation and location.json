{"confidence_score":0.98,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box (Image 1) and the blue box (Image 2) appear to have similar positioning and structure, both being close to a corner and featuring a flat top typical of a toilet. The color and style match, suggesting these are part of the same model or object. The differences were due to lighting and angle, not actual distinctions in the object."}
