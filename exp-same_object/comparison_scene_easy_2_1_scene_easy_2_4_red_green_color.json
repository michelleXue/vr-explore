{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer review of the images, the chairs in the specified regions appear to be identical in design, including the shape and structure. However, considering potential subtle differences in texture or small details that aren't prominently visible, there's a small chance they could be different chairs of the same model. Despite this, the chairs are visually the same in color and form, consistent with being the same object. Hence, I retain that they are the same object but adjust the confidence score to 0.85 to reflect the possibility of subtle differences."}
