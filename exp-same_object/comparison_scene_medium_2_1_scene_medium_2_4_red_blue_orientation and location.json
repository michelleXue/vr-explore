{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the objects' positions and surroundings are similar, there might be subtle differences in appearance that were initially overlooked. The two objects could have differences in features like labels or surface details that aren't immediately visible. These subtle details could indicate they are different objects, necessitating a slightly lower confidence score. Without more distinctive features visible, it remains uncertain but suggests they are not the same."}
