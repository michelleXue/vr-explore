{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in the specified regions are similar in general appearance, being white and cylindrical. However, a subtle detail such as their tilting angle in the second image suggests they might not be the same. In the second image, the object within the green box appears to be slightly tilted compared to the first image's object in the red box. This difference could imply they are different objects, or that one has been moved or rotated, but without definitive features to prove they are the same. Given this uncertainty, they are likely not the same object."}
