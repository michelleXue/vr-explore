{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further inspection, the objects in both images appear almost identical in shape, size, and position on the shelf. The environment around them, such as the green tiled wall and the shelf, is consistent. The object in the red box in Image 1 and the green box in Image 2 are both cylindrical and have similar color and lighting. There may be slight changes due to image angles or lighting, but no definitive unique features indicate they are different objects. The evidence supports them being the same object with high confidence."}
