{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"object1_description":"A white cylindrical cup on a shelf.","object2_description":"A white cylindrical cup on a shelf.","reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both objects are white cylindrical cups, there may be subtle differences in texture or brightness that indicate they are not the same object. The context, position on the shelf, and possible variations in proportions also suggest a different item. No unique identifying marks are visible to definitively prove they are or aren't the same object, but a slight disparity in the images suggests a different cup is depicted."}
