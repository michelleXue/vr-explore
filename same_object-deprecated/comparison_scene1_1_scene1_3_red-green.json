{"confidence_score":0.90,"is_same_object":true,"object1_description":"Dark wooden chair with armrests and vertical slats on the backrest.","object2_description":"Dark wooden chair with armrests and vertical slats on the backrest.","reasoning":"Upon further review, the objects in both images remain highly similar. Both are dark wooden chairs with armrests and a backrest with vertical slats. While there may be minor variations due to perspective or lighting differences, none significantly impact the identification. The chairs are positioned similarly in relation to the table, maintaining consistent orientation and proportions. No uniquely distinctive markings or features were observed that would clearly differentiate them. However, slight variations typical of 3D renderings could slightly affect confidence. Despite this, the design, material, and structure strongly indicate they are the same object, with a minor adjustment to the confidence score to account for typical slight differences in perspective or rendering.\"}"}
