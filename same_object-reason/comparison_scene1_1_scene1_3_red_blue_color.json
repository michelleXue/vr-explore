{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the chairs in the red and blue boxes appear to be of the same type and design, both featuring a wooden structure with armrests. There are no visible distinguishing marks or differences that suggest they are different objects, with only their positioning relative to the table and other parts of the room consistent between images. The consistent style and color across both images support the determination that these are the same chairs. Any subtle variations in lighting or angle don't appear significant enough to impact this conclusion."}
