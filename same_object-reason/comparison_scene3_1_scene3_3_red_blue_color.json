{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"On closer inspection, both objects are glasses that share the same basic shape and color, which is a light grey or white. They are placed in a similar context on a shelf with other similar items. The primary focus is on color, which seems consistent between the two images, supporting the conclusion that they are likely the same object. However, since the angles may vary slightly, there's a small chance of differences not visible in the images, slightly affecting confidence."}
