{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in the red box (Image 1) and blue box (Image 2) are in similar environments but differ in orientation. The object in the blue box in Image 2 is aligned differently compared to the object in the red box of Image 1. This difference suggests they might not be the same object. Additionally, the visibility of surroundings in Image 2 could slightly affect the consistency check, leading to uncertainty in the exact positioning of these objects."}
