{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further examination, both objects within the specified regions are indeed the same. They have identical shapes and labels and are positioned consistently on the shelf. The lighting and perspective of the images provide clear enough angles to support that they are the same object. There are no unique identifying features that prove otherwise. Therefore, my conclusion remains that they are the same object, with a confidence score slightly adjusted to 0.9 due to the need for careful scrutiny."}
