{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination:\n\n1. **Color**: The chairs in both images appear to share the same brown wood tone, indicating a likely match in material.\n\n2. **Shape and Design Details**: The backrest, armrests, and seat design are consistent between both chairs, with no visible unique elements that differentiate them.\n\n3. **Perspective**: The perspective and angle differ slightly, but the structural elements remain consistent, such as the backrest slat count and thickness of the legs.\n\n4. **Positioning**: Both are placed next to a similar table, supporting the assumption of similar function and possibly identical model.\n\nGiven these considerations, the chairs are likely the same object or at least the same model, with no unique differentiating features present in the perspectives provided.\n\nConfidence score is adjusted slightly to 0.85 to account for any unseen aspects due to different angles, though the likelihood remains high."}
