{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the chairs in both images appear to be the same. They have identical color and design, including the same style of armrests and backrest panels. The angle and perspective change between images could account for slight visual differences, but the consistency in design and overall placement strongly suggests they are the same object. The room setting also matches, supporting this conclusion. A higher confidence score of 0.95 reflects the consistent features matching across both images."}
