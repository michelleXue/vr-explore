{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the VHS tapes appear to have slightly different labeling. In the first image (red box), the label appears to have specific markings or symbols that are not identical to those in the second image (green box). This subtle difference in labeling suggests they may be different objects, despite the similarity in shape and type. The context and lighting remain consistent, but the unique features on each label lean towards them being different objects."}
