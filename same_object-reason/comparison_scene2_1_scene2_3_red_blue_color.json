{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both objects are VHS tapes and share similar overall shape, the label color and design on the central part differs subtly. The tape in the red box (Image 1) and the tape in the blue box (Image 2) may have minor differences in label color or markings, indicating they are not identical. As these details are key to identifying uniqueness, I am less confident they are the same, thus revising the confidence score to 0.6 and concluding they are likely not the same object."}
