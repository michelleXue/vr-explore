{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box in Image 1 and the one in the green box in Image 2 match in shape and design. Both objects are located in the same position on the shelf, and there are no visible differences that would suggest they are not the same. The consistent pattern and orientation confirm that they are indeed identical. The only potentially subtle detail, like lighting or angle, does not significantly affect the comparison."}
