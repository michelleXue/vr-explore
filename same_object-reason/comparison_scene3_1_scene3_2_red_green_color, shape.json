{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, both objects appear to be cylindrical items, possibly cups or glasses, with a similar gray coloration. The placement and environment are the same, which supports the likelihood they are the same object. However, slight differences in lighting or perspective might create minor discrepancies. These subtle differences are not significant enough to confidently declare them different objects."}
