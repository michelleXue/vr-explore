{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, the chairs in both images have identical designs, with similar backrest patterns, armrests, and legs. The position relative to the table and the overall room setup is the same, indicating they are likely the same object. However, subtle visual differences between images might be due to slight variations in perspective or lighting, but they do not significantly affect the conclusion. Given the consistent environment and object features, it's reasonable to conclude they are the same object."}
