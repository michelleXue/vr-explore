{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, the chairs in both images have the same brown color and appear to have the same design. They are positioned similarly relative to the table, which also suggests that they are likely the same chair viewed from slightly different angles. There are no visible unique markings or significant differences in design or placement that would suggest they are different objects. Therefore, the analysis remains consistent that they are the same object, with a high confidence score, given the similar attributes and context within the room."}
