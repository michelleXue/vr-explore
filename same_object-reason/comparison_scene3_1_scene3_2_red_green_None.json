{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the angles and lighting slightly differ, and there is a noticeable rotation in the object in the green box compared to the red box. This subtle change might indicate they are different instances. Although they appear identical in type, the rotation suggests they might not be the exact same object. The environment and setup are consistent, but this detail lowers confidence in them being the exact same object."}
