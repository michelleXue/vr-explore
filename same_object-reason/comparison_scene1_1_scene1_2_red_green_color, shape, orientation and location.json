{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both objects are chairs with similar dark brown coloring and wooden slat designs on the backrest. The orientation of the chairs in relation to the table is consistent, suggesting they are the same object viewed from different perspectives. However, subtle differences in lighting and angle may create slight visual discrepancies. No unique distinguishing features are evident that would definitively separate these objects. Therefore, while there are minor uncertainties, it's still more likely they are the same object, warranting a slight adjustment in the confidence score."}
