{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in both images are glasses. They have a similar color and shape, suggesting they might be the same. The environment, such as the shelf and wall tile, also appears identical, supporting the likelihood of them being the same object. However, the angle and perspective slightly differ, which could cause minor discrepancies. Overall, no unique features identify them as distinctly different."}
