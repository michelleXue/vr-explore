{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, there are subtle differences in the label colors on the cassette tapes that might have been overlooked initially. The tape in the red box of Image 1 has a yellow label, while the one in the green box of Image 2 has a similar label, but potential differences in hue or markings could distinguish them. Given the potential for these small differences, I reevaluated my analysis and lowered my confidence. Without definitive, unique identifying features proving they are the same, it is safer to conclude they are not the same object."}
