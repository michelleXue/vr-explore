{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon further review, the chairs in both images have the same design characteristics, including the backrest style and the armrest construction. The color of the wood and the overall form align closely in both images. The lighting and angle changes do not significantly alter my initial assessment. While minor perspective variations exist, they do not provide enough evidence to claim the objects are different. The consistent design and color strongly indicate they are the same object."}
