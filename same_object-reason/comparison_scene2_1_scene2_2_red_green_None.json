{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects seem to have the same shape and general design, including the label area and outer casing.

However, due to potential lighting and angle differences, the confidence score is adjusted to reflect a slight uncertainty."}
