{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects have subtle differences that are apparent in their shapes or orientations, which could imply they are not the same. While the general color and design are similar, these variations suggest they could be different objects. Without distinct features to unequivocally prove they are the same, the confidence score is reduced."}
