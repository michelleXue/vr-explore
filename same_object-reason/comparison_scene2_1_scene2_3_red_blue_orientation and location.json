{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects in the specified regions have similar appearances but their positions and context have changed significantly. In Image 1, the object in the red box is on the upper shelf, while in Image 2, the object in the blue box is on the lower table. The main potential differentiator is their location and subtle variations in lighting or reflections. Without unique identifying marks visible, these differences lead to the possibility that they are not the same object despite their visual similarity."}
