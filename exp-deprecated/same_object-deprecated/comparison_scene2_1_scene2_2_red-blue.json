{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":false,"object1_description":"Rectangular black object with a yellow label that has triangular arrows.","object2_description":"Rectangular black object with a pink label that has triangular arrows.","reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects differ mainly in the color of their labels. Image 1 has a yellow label, whereas Image 2's object has a pink label. While the shape, size, and design are consistent, this distinct difference in label color suggests they are not the same object. The material and texture appear similar, but the unique identifying feature of label color strongly suggests they are different, leading to a lower confidence score in them being the same object."}
