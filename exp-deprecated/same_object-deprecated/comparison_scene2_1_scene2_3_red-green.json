{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"object1_description":"A VHS tape with a yellowish label and dark casing, labeled with geometric shapes.","object2_description":"A VHS tape with a yellowish label and dark casing, labeled with geometric shapes.","reasoning":"Upon careful review, the objects in question are both VHS tapes that feature a yellowish label with geometric shapes resembling inward-pointing arrows. They have a dark casing, similar shape, and size, and the same orientation on the shelf. There are no noticeable distinctive features or variations in texture and color that suggest they are different objects. Any subtle lighting differences are likely due to image capture and not the objects themselves. Thus, it's reasonable to conclude they are indeed the same object."}
