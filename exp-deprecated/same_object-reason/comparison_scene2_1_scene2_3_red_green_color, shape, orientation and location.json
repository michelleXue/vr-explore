{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while the objects in both images share a similar general shape and type as VHS tapes, there are subtle differences in positioning. In Image 1, the tape is positioned towards the left on the shelf, while in Image 2, it is further to the right, suggesting a potential movement or a different object placement. Additionally, subtle details like any specific markings or reflections might differ, affecting the judgment. These differences lead to the conclusion that they might not be the exact same object, lowering the confidence score slightly."}
