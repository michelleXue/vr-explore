{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, while both chairs have a similar design, there are subtle differences in the angle and height of the backs of the chairs. Additionally, the position relative to the table differs slightly in perspective, suggesting they might be different instances of similar chairs rather than the exact same object. Unique identifying features such as any visible distinct wear or specific wood grain patterns aren't evident, leaving some room for doubt."}
