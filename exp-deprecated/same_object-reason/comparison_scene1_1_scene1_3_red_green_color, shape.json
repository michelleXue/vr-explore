{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the chairs in the images have some subtle differences. The back support of the chair in Image 1 (red box) seems to have a different slat design compared to the chair in Image 2 (green box). These differences, although subtle, suggest they are not identical. The color and general style are similar, but these specific design features lead to lower confidence in them being the same object."}
