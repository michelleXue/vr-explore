{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the chairs in both images are very similar, sharing the same wooden structure, color, and design features such as armrests and the slatted back. The positioning in relation to the table is also very similar. However, the angle and lighting might create slight visual differences, such as shadowing or perspective distortions. There don't appear to be distinguishing marks or features that set them apart. Based on these observations, it is highly likely they are the same object, though minor differences due to perspective are considered, reducing confidence slightly."}
