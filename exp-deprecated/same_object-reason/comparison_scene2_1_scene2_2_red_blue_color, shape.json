{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon review, the key distinguishing feature is the color of the labels on the objects; the object in Image 1 has a yellow label, while the object in Image 2 has a pink label. This difference in label color is a definitive indicator that they are not the same object, despite having a similar shape as cassette tapes. No other unique identifying features suggest they are the same."}
