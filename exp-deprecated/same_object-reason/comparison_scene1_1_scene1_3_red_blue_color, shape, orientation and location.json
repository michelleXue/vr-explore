{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the chairs in both images maintain a consistent design, including the backrest, arms, and seat shape. While the perspectives are different, both chairs share similar proportions and wood coloring which are characteristic of the same object. The main challenge is the slight variance in perspective and potential subtle details that might not be visible due to the image angles, but the overall characteristics such as shape, structure, and appearance strongly suggest they are the same object."}
