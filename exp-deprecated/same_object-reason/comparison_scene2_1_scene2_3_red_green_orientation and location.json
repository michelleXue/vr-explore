{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, although the objects in both images are similar in shape and position, the object in the red box in Image 1 slightly differs in orientation from the object in the green box in Image 2. Specifically, the angle appears subtly different. This difference suggests that while they look very similar, they may not be the same object, or the object might have been repositioned between shots. Unique identifying features like labels and exact positioning lead to this updated conclusion."}
