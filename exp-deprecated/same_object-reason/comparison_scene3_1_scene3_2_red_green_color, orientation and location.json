{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the object in the red box of Image 1 and the object in the green box of Image 2 appear very similar in color and shape. Both objects are situated on the same shelf at the same height relative to the other objects around them. The initial perceived tilt in the second image might be due to the angle or perspective of the image. Therefore, they are likely the same object."}
