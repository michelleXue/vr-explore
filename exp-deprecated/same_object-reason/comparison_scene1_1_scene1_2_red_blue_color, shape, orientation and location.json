{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both chairs have the same design features, including the structure of the backrest and armrests, as well as uniform color. The orientation relative to the table is also consistent between the two images. Although subtle differences in lighting might give slight visual variations, there are no unique identifying features that suggest they are different objects. Thus, it's very likely they are the same object, although the different angles introduce slight uncertainty."}
