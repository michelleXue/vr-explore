{"confidence_score":0.75,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both objects are white and cylindrical, positioned similarly on a shelf in a consistent setting. Although the lighting and angle differ slightly between the images, these variations are minor. There are no unique identifying features in terms of pattern or significant distinct markings that indicate they are not the same. Therefore, it's likely they represent the same or identical objects placed in the same location."}
