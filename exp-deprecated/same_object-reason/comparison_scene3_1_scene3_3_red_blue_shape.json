{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, both objects have a cylindrical shape typical of drinking glasses. The lighting and angle between the two images might cause slight visual differences, but no unique features suggest they are different. The overall context, position on the shelf, and repetitive design in the setting support the conclusion that these are the same type of object. Therefore, they are likely the same object, with a slightly reduced confidence score of 0.8 due to minor visual variations."}
