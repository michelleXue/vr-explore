{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"1. **Subtle Details**: Upon closer inspection, both chairs have an identical structure in terms of the backrest, armrests, and seat. Any minor differences might be due to lighting or shadow effects.\n\n2. **Differences**: There's no significant difference in the shape or prominent features that would suggest they are different objects. The alignment and positioning with respect to the table are consistent.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The backrest and armrest design remain identical across both images, indicating that they are the same object. No distinct differences are observed that would point towards them being separate pieces.\n\nOverall, given these observations focusing on unique and similar features, the objects appear to be the same, but considering potential lighting effects, the confidence is adjusted to 0.85. The consistency in structure and shape strongly supports they are the same object in both images."}
