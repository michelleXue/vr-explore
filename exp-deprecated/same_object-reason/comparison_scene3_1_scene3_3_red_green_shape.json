{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the object in both images maintains the same rectangular and cylindrical features typically associated with a standard cup design. There are no significant differences in angle or shape that could indicate these are different objects. Although details such as color and texture are harder to discern, the consistency in shape across both images strongly suggests they are the same object. Unique identifying features remain constant, supporting this conclusion."}
