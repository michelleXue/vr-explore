{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the chairs in both images appear essentially identical. They have the same overall design: the structure, style of the backrest, and armrests. The color remains consistent across both images, indicating they are likely the same object. However, subtle lighting or angle changes could create slight visual discrepancies, but these are not enough to strongly indicate they are different objects. Given the consistent color and design, they most likely represent the same object."}
