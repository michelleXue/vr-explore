{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in both images have the same shape and design. In the first image, the object is centrally placed and upright. In the second image, although the object in the green box appears slightly tilted, there are no unique identifying features distinguishing it from the first image. The spatial orientation and position relative to the overall shelf structure are consistent, indicating they are the same object with a different orientation."}
