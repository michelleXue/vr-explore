{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer examination, the objects within the specified regions in both images retain the same basic cylindrical shape and color, suggesting they are similar objects, likely glasses or cups. The arrangement on the shelf is consistent, but subtle differences in lighting or angle might slightly alter appearances. However, there are no unique identifying features that clearly differentiate the objects, leading to the conclusion that they are likely the same, but with slightly reduced confidence in case of any minor overlooked details."}
