{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, it appears that the objects in both the red box in Image 1 and the green box in Image 2 are similar armchairs. Both have a similar shape, design, and features such as the backrest and armrests. While there could be subtle differences due to lighting or angle, there are no unique identifying features that clearly differentiate them as separate objects. The chairs appear to be consistent in style and color. Thus, it is likely they are the same object, with a high confidence score of 0.9."}
