{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"On closer inspection, both objects in the red and green boxes appear to be glasses on the same shelf. However, the orientation of the object in the green box in Image 2 is noticeably tilted, while the object in the red box in Image 1 is upright. This change in orientation suggests that they might not be the same object or might have been moved between shots, altering their position slightly. This distinction leads to a decreased confidence in them being the same object."}
