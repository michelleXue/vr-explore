{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon re-evaluating the images, the objects in question are both wooden chairs featuring identical design elements. Both chairs have a similar backrest structure with horizontal slats, identical armrests, and wooden legs. The color and texture also match perfectly. No distinct or unique identifying marks differentiate them, supporting the conclusion that they are the same object. Despite potential changes in angles or lighting, these subtle details align closely enough to affirm the initial assessment."}
