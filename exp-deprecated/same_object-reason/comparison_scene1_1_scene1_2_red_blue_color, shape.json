{"confidence_score":0.9,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the chairs in both images appear to have the same distinctive design elements such as the straight, simple backrest and armrests, and a similar brown wooden material. There are no noticeable differences in structure or design that suggest they are different. The consistency in color and design reinforces the conclusion that they are the same object. However, subtle differences in lighting and angle do exist, slightly lowering confidence."}
