{"confidence_score":1.0,"is_same_object":true,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images, the object within the red box in Image 1 and the blue box in Image 2 are indeed the same. The objects have an identical cylindrical shape and position in relation to the shelving unit, with no discernible differences in detailing or design that would suggest they are different. Their orientation and context within the environment (on a middle shelf) also match. There are no unique identifying features that disprove their similarity. Therefore, the judgment remains unchanged."}
