{"confidence_score":0.6,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the chairs in the red and blue boxes appear similar in design and color but may not be the same object. The key difference lies in the positioning and orientation â€” in the first image, the chair backs are more parallel to the edge of the table, while in the second image, the blue-boxed chair is positioned differently, suggesting it might be a separate chair. Without unique identifying features, such as distinctive markings or defects, this analysis leans towards them being different objects due to differing orientations."}
