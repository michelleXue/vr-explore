{"confidence_score":0.85,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects in the specified regions have slight differences that might affect the judgment. In Image 2, the object in the blue box seems to have a tilt that is not present in Image 1's red box object, suggesting a potential difference in orientation or placement. While the color and shape are similar, this tilt could indicate they are not the same object. Without unique identifying features such as labels or markings, it's challenging to definitively determine they are the same, leading to a revised assessment."}
