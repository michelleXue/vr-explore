{"confidence_score":0.8,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, consider that there are subtle differences that might have been overlooked initially. In the second image, the blue-boxed object is oriented slightly differently compared to the red-boxed object in the first image. Also, the presence of an additional object to its left in the second image could indicate a difference in positioning or rearrangement. Without any unique identifying marks on the objects themselves, the possibility of them being moved or being different objects is more plausible. As such, the confidence score has been adjusted accordingly, and they are likely not the same object."}
