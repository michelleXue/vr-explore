{"confidence_score":0.4,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon reviewing the images again, there are factors suggesting the objects may not be the same:\n\n1. **Shape and Size:**\n   - While both objects are cylindrical, the precise dimensions might differ subtly. This can affect the judgment of whether they are identical objects.\n\n2. **Lighting and Shadows:**\n   - The lighting and shadowing are similar, but this alone isn't definitive due to the angle and potential placement differences affecting perception.\n\n3. **Location & Orientation:**\n   - The location of the objects within their respective shelves in the images varies slightly. This kind of subtle detail might suggest a different object or at least a different instance of the same type.\n\n4. **Unique Features:**\n   - In closer inspection, any unique detailing or markings are not visible with clarity, making it difficult to definitively state they are the same.\n\nGiven these nuanced observations, the initial high confidence was too optimistic. The assessment leans towards them being different objects, prompting a confidence score adjustment to reflect the uncertainty."}
