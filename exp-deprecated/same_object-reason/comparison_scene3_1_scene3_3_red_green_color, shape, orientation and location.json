{"confidence_score":0.7,"is_same_object":false,"reasoning":"Upon closer inspection, the objects appear similar in color and shape, but they differ in their placement relative to other objects. The red-boxed object in Image 1 is placed slightly more to the right compared to the green-boxed object in Image 2. While the differences are subtle, the distinct positions relative to other items suggest they might not be the same object. Unique identifying features are not definitive, leading to a lower confidence score."}
