{"confidence_score":0.95,"is_same_object":true,"object1_description":"White cylindrical cup on a shelf.","object2_description":"White cylindrical cup on a shelf in the same position as the first image.","reasoning":"Upon re-evaluation, both objects still appear to be white cylindrical cups with similar dimensions and placement within their respective images. The lighting and positioning are consistent, and no unique differences such as markings or variances in texture are apparent that would suggest they are different objects. However, subtle lighting or angle differences could influence perception, but given the available information, they seem identical."}
